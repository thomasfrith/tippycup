Brief code to investigate the following question: How full does a bottle of water have to be to make it most stable when sliding across a table?
Plots are for shape of bottle and fraction of liquid. Then coloured by how fast you have to push it to make it fall. White areas are fully stable (never falls no matter how fast it is pushed).
Also included is a basic animation in Javascript.
